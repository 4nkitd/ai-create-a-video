Hey what's up guys? I'm MKBHD and welcome back to another video. Today we're going to talk about three interesting topics in the tech world: ChatGPT4, Paytring, and HyperSwitch. Let's get into it.

First up, ChatGPT4. This is the latest and most advanced version of OpenAI's text generation model that can create realistic and engaging conversations with humans. ChatGPT4 surpasses its predecessor ChatGPT3 in its advanced reasoning capabilities and instruction-following skills. It can also generate content such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, and more. OpenAI says that ChatGPT4 is a product of their safety research and that they used it to help create training data for model fine-tuning and iterate on classifiers across training, evaluations, and monitoring. ChatGPT4 is available as a product on OpenAI's website [^1^][1] and you can try it out for yourself.

Next up, Paytring. This is a payment orchestration platform that integrates payment providers and acquirers from all over the world, offering a unified communication, control, and management interface. Paytring is designed for OMNI businesses and payment institutions that want to optimize their payment operations and reduce costs. Paytring claims to offer features such as smart routing, fraud prevention, reconciliation, analytics, and more. You can check out their website [^2^][2] for more details.

And finally, HyperSwitch. This is an open source financial switch that makes it easy to integrate with different payment processors like Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay, etc. HyperSwitch is developed by Juspay, an Indian company that provides payment solutions for online merchants. HyperSwitch aims to simplify the payment integration process by being wire-compatible with top processors and offering a simple API. HyperSwitch also supports features such as multi-currency support, dynamic routing, fallback mechanisms, etc. You can find HyperSwitch on GitHub [^3^][3] and try it out in their sandbox environment or with their React demo app.

So those are the three topics I wanted to share with you today. Let me know what you think of them in the comments below. Do you think ChatGPT4 is the future of conversational AI? Would you use Paytring or HyperSwitch for your payment needs? I'd love to hear your thoughts. As always, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one. Peace.
